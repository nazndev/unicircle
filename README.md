# 🟣 UniCircle — Full-Stack Production Guide

## Overview
**UniCircle** is a next-generation campus network that evolves with its users — starting as a student social app and transitioning into a verified alumni and professional ecosystem. It integrates social discovery (crushes, circles, feed), job networking, and a marketplace for campus housing and resale.

The platform is designed to meet **Google Play** and **App Store** compliance, with a fully containerized backend, continuous integration, and secure data handling.
